## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The topic I'm interested with this data set is to compare adult's incomes relating to their education level. I hope to collect each entries education background and link it to their income being < 50k/year or >= 50k/year. I've always wondered how education important of a role education plays into getting a decent paying job. Another aspect with this data that I want to cover is which area of work from the given categories have the most incomes that are above 50k/year and which ones have the most that are below or equal to 50k/year. Another interest with this data is to see what the most common industry is that was tested. Another analysis I'd conduct would be to check the ratio of people with different ethnicities and native countries from this data set and provide which ones are most common and least common.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset was provided by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data consists from people with 14 attributes including education, workclass, occupation, sex, native-country, etc. and then lists their yearly income as >50k or <=50k. This data was donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository in 1996. The purpose of this data set is to "Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data." The data was extracted from a 1994 Census database.
